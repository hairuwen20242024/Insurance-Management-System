    "\n",
    "#### Task 3: Fundamentals of Angular and Spring Boot\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Angular Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction to Angular**\n",
    "   - Angular is a platform and framework for building client-side applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.\n",
    "   - Developed and maintained by Google, Angular is widely used for creating dynamic and single-page applications (##### SPAs).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Core Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "   2.1 **Components**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications. Each component consists of an HTML template, a TypeScript class, and optional CSS styles.\n",
    "   - **Structure**:\n",
    "     - **Template**: Defines the view of the component using HTML.\n",
    "     - **Class**: Contains the logic and data for the component.\n",
    "     - **Styles**: Optional CSS styles specific to the component.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```typescript\n",
    "     import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n",
    "\n",
    "     @Component({\n",
    "       selector: 'app-hello-world',\n",
    "       template: `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`,\n",
    "       styles: [`h1 { font-family: Lato; }`]\n",
    "     })\n",
    "     export class HelloWorldComponent {\n",
    "       // Component logic\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   2.2 **Modules**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Modules are used to organize an Angular application into cohesive blocks of functionality. Every Angular application has at least one module, the root module.\n",
    "   - **Structure**:\n",
    "     - **Imports**: Other Angular modules that this module depends on.\n",
    "     - **Declarations**: Components, directives, and pipes that belong to this module.\n",
    "     - **Providers**: Services that the module uses.\n",
    "     - **Bootstrap**: The root component that Angular creates and inserts into the index.html host web page.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```typescript\n",
    "     import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n",
    "     import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\n",
    "     import { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n",
    "     import { HelloWorldComponent } from './hello-world/hello-world.component';\n",
    "\n",
    "     @NgModule({\n",
    "       declarations: [\n",
    "         AppComponent,\n",
    "         HelloWorldComponent\n",
    "       ],\n",
    "       imports: [\n",
    "         BrowserModule\n",
    "       ],\n",
    "       providers: [],\n",
    "       bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n",
    "     })\n",
    "     export class AppModule { }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   2.3 **Templates**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Templates define the HTML view of a component and can use Angular's template syntax for binding data and handling user interactions.\n",
    "   - **Binding Syntax**:\n",
    "     - **Interpolation**: `{{ expression }}`\n",
    "     - **Property Binding**: `[property]=\"expression\"`\n",
    "     - **Event Binding**: `(event)=\"handler\"`\n",
    "     - **Two-way Binding**: `[(ngModel)]=\"property\"`\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```html\n",
    "     <h1>{{ title }}</h1>\n",
    "     <button (click)=\"onClick()\">Click me</button>\n",
    "     <input [(ngModel)]=\"userInput\">\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   2.4 **Services**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Services are used to share data and logic across multiple components. They are typically used for business logic, data fetching, and other operations.\n",
    "   - **Dependency Injection**: Angular uses dependency injection to provide services to components and other services.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```typescript\n",
    "     import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "      getData() {\n",
    "        return ['Data 1', 'Data 2', 'Data 3'];\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "   ```lication to check if the message is displayed successfully and the search component works.\n",
